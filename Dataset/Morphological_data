Genetic
engineering
is
an
important
issue
in
society
today
.
I
am
convinced
that
genetic
engineering
will
have
a
positive
impact
on
our
lives
,
and
that
people
's
fears
will
be
unwarranted
.
In
many
countries
today
,
people
in
cities
either
live
alone
or
in
small
family
units
,
rather
than
in
large
,
extended
family
groups
.
I
enjoy
hot
weather
.
I
love
spring
when
trees
and
flowers
blossom
.
I
love
swimming
and
sunbathing
.
I
accidentally
saw
it
on
TV
2
years
ago
.
I
just
can
â€™
t
stop
loving
the
story
in
the
ad
.
I
saw
it
in
many
public
places
.
Digital
marketing
has
proved
successful
in
many
fields
.
Last
year
I
went
to
Singapore
.
I
stayed
there
for
2
weeks
.
I
traveled
to
Singapore
with
my
best
friends
.
We
moved
mostly
by
MRT
and
taxi
.
It
has
changed
a
lot
.
I
forgot
my
books
for
the
math
class
.
I
will
buy
a
new
car
.
I
have
not
booked
a
table
yet
.
Which
university
do
you
want
to
get
in
?
It
does
not
taste
right
.
We
took
a
lot
of
pictures
.
Where
is
the
cinema
?
I
think
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
bill
.
Education
is
a
significant
tool
that
provides
knowledge
,
skill
,
technique
and
information
to
people
.
This
summer
I
will
visit
a
new
country
with
two
of
my
best
friends
.
In
some
countries
,
young
people
are
encouraged
to
work
or
travel
for
a
year
between
finishing
high
school
and
starting
university
studies
.
It
is
true
that
traveling
activities
have
increased
rapidly
in
the
past
,
and
people
are
traveling
for
various
kinds
of
purposes
.
Traveling
can
shift
our
outlook
of
life
in
a
better
way
and
gives
us
more
ideas
about
the
way
of
life
around
the
world
.
The
behavior
that
parents
deliver
and
the
value
they
convey
certainly
have
a
colossal
impact
on
their
children
's
personality
.
In
a
city
people
have
access
to
many
different
transportation
systems
and
have
the
latest
technologies
to
communicate
like
the
internet
.
Some
people
go
to
universities
to
get
further
education
,
enhance
their
horizon
and
improve
their
job
position
and
salary
.
Computers
could
replace
many
manual
laborers
in
most
of
the
manufacturing
companies
.
I
hope
to
establish
a
business
relationship
with
your
company
.
He
is
an
authority
on
digital
cameras
.
Computers
are
considered
as
the
most
revolutionary
invention
for
the
development
of
human
beings
.
Online
shopping
has
become
more
popular
.
